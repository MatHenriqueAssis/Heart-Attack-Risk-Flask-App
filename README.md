# Heart Attack Risk Prediction

## Project Summary

The project aims to create a predictive model to assess the risk of a heart attack for a patient. Using historical data of patients, the model analyzes factors such as age, gender, hypertension, and family history to predict the risk of a heart attack in three categories: low, moderate, and high. The predictive model is implemented using **Decision Trees** and **Random Forest** algorithms.

The project also includes a web application built with **Flask**, allowing users to input their data and receive a heart attack risk prediction.

## Objectives

- Predict the risk of a heart attack based on clinical data.
- Implement a machine learning model using **Decision Trees** and **Random Forest**.
- Create an interactive web interface where users can make heart attack risk predictions.

## Key Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language for data analysis and model creation.
- **Pandas**: Library for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Numpy**: Library for numerical calculations.
- **Scikit-Learn**: Machine learning framework providing models like Decision Tree and Random Forest.
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn**: Libraries for data visualization.
- **Flask**: Web framework for building the application that interacts with the predictive model.
- **Pickle**: Library for saving and loading trained models.
